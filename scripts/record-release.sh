#
# Record a release on the branches that say what shipped.
#
#   deployed  the record of what was last tagged, a release candidate or a final.
#   main      the prod record. Only a FINAL on a prod target moves it, to the commit
#             that the final's tag names, fast-forward only. A candidate never does.
#
# Both branches move by a plain push of the tag's commit. A push that is not a
# fast-forward is refused by this script and by git. Nothing here forces anything,
# and nothing deletes a branch.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/record-release.sh check   <version> <env> <integration-branch> <record-branch>
#   scripts/record-release.sh advance <version> <env> <integration-branch> <record-branch>
#
#   <env>            dev or prod: the env of the Foreman target.
#   <record-branch>  the deployed_branch of the Foreman target. A prod target holds the
#                    prod record (main). A dev target holds `deployed`, or the branch
#                    that Foreman scopes to one objective for a candidate.
#
# `check` runs BEFORE the tag. It refuses a record that does not fit the env, a final
# that is not cut from the commit a candidate shipped, and a final whose commit could
# not fast-forward main, so no tag and no image exist when the refusal happens.
# `advance` runs AFTER the release is verified and prints the facts main_before,
# main_after and main_equals_final for a final on a prod target.
